# dnSpy.Extension.Wasm

## Compatibility
This extension targets dnSpyEx v6.1.9 and is not tested with any other version
or distribution. 

## Debugging
Run `build.ps1 netframework` in the dnSpy submodule using the Visual Studio
developer powershell, then use the provided run command for JetBrains Rider.

If you don't use Rider, you can start dnSpy with the `--extension-directory`
parameter to quickly load the extension.
